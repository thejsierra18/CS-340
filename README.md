    How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 
    Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, 
    which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. 
    What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
    
    In order to write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable, it's necessary to be modular, apply the principles of 
    Object Oriented Programming, and use comments. The CRUD Python module is an example of these, as
    it defined a Class, and the different functions associated with said Class. By importing the module,
    we were able to instantiate the CRUD object, and use it. There were brief but descriptive comments
    throughout the module, and it can be reused, since it is a module.
    
    How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached 
    the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your 
    approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or 
    strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
    
    Problem solving as a computer scientist requires of multiple steps. First, we collect the requirements, and analyze use cases.
    We create the design documents, and from there, working in iterations, as we build the program. This program was no different,
    we started by creating a CRUD module, next a user interface with Dash. We connected the front-end and back-end, and we added more
    functionality on each iteration.
    
    What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this 
    type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
    
    Computer Scientists create solutions to unique issues. Often times, we help automate and make other people's
    job easier. In this case. the Dashboard we created, gave the employees of Grazioso Salvare a user friendly interface to
    interact with a database. We gave them data visualization tools, and helped improve their queries.
